% Example:
%
% Texture Recognition
%
%
%
% In addition, the database containing all texture images
% can be downloaded from Brodatz database:
%
%      http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~xia/invariant_texture/invariant_texture_brodatz/brodatz_image/
%
% The images are available in Dropbox folder 'textures/'
%
% In this example there are 111 different textures and 9 images per
% texture. The idea is to design a classifier that is able to separate
% the 111 classes. We use 8 images (per class) for training and only one
% (per class) per testing. Of course they are disjoint sets. The accuracy
% is computed as the rate of correctly classified samples.
%
% In this code, we use LBP features only (rotation invariant). We test a 
% knn classifier with k=1. The accuracy is computed (83.78%).
