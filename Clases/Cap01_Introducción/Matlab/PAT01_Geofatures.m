% Example:

%

% Recognition of 'Y', 'T' using geometric features

%

% This example uses the eccentricity to separate T and Y.

%

% The classification is performed using a threshold computed as the

% average of the class centroids.

%

% The best separability is given by the feature called 'Eccentricity' ? 

% From documentation of command 'regionprops' of Matlab:

% Scalar that specifies the eccentricity of the ellipse that has the same 

% second-moments as the region. The eccentricity is the ratio of the 

% distance between the foci of the ellipse and its major axis length. 

% The value is between 0 and 1. (0 and 1 are degenerate cases; an ellipse 

% whose eccentricity is 0 is actually a circle, while an ellipse whose 

% eccentricity is 1 is a line segment.) This property is supported only for 

% 2-D input label matrices.
